and so I couldn't embed any videos.-->
<!-- Also, I feel like the "p" paragraph and "form" commands are the same? -->

<h1>Beginner concepts</h1>
<p><b>What is the internet?</b></p>
  The internet is computers sharing information world wide. <br>
Text, photos, videos; music -- most content exists as html files. <br><b>Html = <em>hyper text markup language</em></b><br>
These html files are stored on local servers around the globe.</p> 
A local server in Kathmandu can talk with a server in Boston<br>
using <b>http, or <em>hypertext transfer protocol.</em></b><br>
Your request for information using a Google search <br> 
sends a retrieval of the correct html files using http.<br>
Then, your computer browser interprets the markup language <br>
in order to display a web page to you. </p>
<p><b>Markup language, or, Tags and Elements</b></p>
<p>Tags are what computers need to read in order to display text a certain way. </p>
<p>For example, <b>bolding</b> can be done using at least two different tags <br>
one using a "b" in brackets < > before and after the text,<br>
and the other using the word "strong." In this course we haven't yet <br>
  learned <em>Why</em> 
  there is this difference and when to use which <br>(though my hunch is 
that the "strong" tag is used in CSS and is more efficient.)
</p>
Elements are the content, for example, headings, titles and images. <br>
Elements can be inline or block.
<b>Bolding</b>, <em>italicizing</em>, anchor tags (indicating a web site link)<br>
or img (image) tags are used "inline."
<p>Clicking here <a href="www.udacity.com">on hyperlink text</a> is an inline command in the code line.
</p>
Tags directing the computer to 
display a new paragraph or create <br>a line break are examples of "block" tags. <br>
What does the "form" tag do?<form> </form> It creates a return carriage to begin a new paragraph after the end tag. Huh.<br>
These block commands also signal an "invisible box" around the content inside that element.<form>
Synonomous terms are <em>span (inline) </em> and <em>div (block).</em>
<p><b> Computers are stupid, ie, literal.</b></p>
You have to code your command exactly.<br>
They cannot interpolate a typo like a human would. One missing end tag, and your sentence will bold on forever!</p>
